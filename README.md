# Current, mostly for thesis-global_climate.

This is a fit version for local laptops with all the locals file readable.

We'll put the eocene solid version here and make further changes.

Currently, 'make_EBM_fluxes_yoush.py' is the standard file to produce normal EBM analysis plots for 12 sets of expts, file '12sims_make.py' is likely a copy of it.
Files, 'amoc_EBM_fluxes.py', 'co2_sensitivity_EBM_fluxes.py', 'humidity_analysis.py' are different versions of codes used to produce standard EBM analysis plots for AMOC series expts (based on PI), for co<sub>2</sub> sensitivity expts based on the 280 ppm expt, and for humidity analysis for standard global climate expts for 4 paleogeogs under 3 co<sub>2</sub> scenarios.
